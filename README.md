I originally had a larger project w/ full CRUD development attached to MongoDB, but there's a glitch I haven't been able to resolve.  Also, I feel like I wasn't taking full advantage of Svelte and that the file structure was a little muddy, so I downsized 

## Creating the project

The company that brought me on in a mentorship capacity uses svelte, so that's why I went with this over other frameworks.  As my background is heavy on vanilla JS, with a cursorary knowledge of Node.js and React, somethings were familiar but there was also a lot of "new" as well.  

Not much to look at here.  Just populating an array w/ inputs, rulling out duplicates and empty values.  Some animation on the addition and subtraction of values and that's about it.  

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
